<p class="lede">This covers the BuildWithBNZ website and workspace, operated by BNZ Builders Inc. Last updated: September 2026.</p>
<h3>What we collect</h3>
<p>When you book a Project Review we collect what you type into the form: your name, company, email, phone, contractor type, a description of the project, an optional bid date and an optional link to your files. The form is relayed to our inquiries inbox; we do not use third-party trackers on this site.</p>
<h3>Project files</h3>
<p>During a Project Review you may share drawings, specs, addenda and bid documents. They are used to prepare the walkthrough and, if we go ahead, the scope document. They are not used to train models, are not shared outside the people working your project, and are deleted on request.</p>
<h3>The workspace</h3>
<p>Once a project is scoped, the crew connects to the systems named in your scope document — Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Workspace, Notion — with read access first. Access is scoped per project. Anything that leaves the workspace (an email to a subcontractor, a request to an architect) waits in your approvals queue until you approve it.</p>
<h3>Who we share with</h3>
<p>Nobody, beyond the service providers needed to run the site and the workspace (hosting, email relay, the model providers that process your project documents under our agreements with them). We do not sell or rent your information.</p>
<h3>Your rights</h3>
<p>Ask us what we hold about you, ask us to correct it, or ask us to delete it: <a class="link" href="mailto:%s">%s</a>.</p>

<p class="lede">These terms cover your use of the BuildWithBNZ website and workspace, operated by BNZ Builders Inc. Last updated: September 2026.</p>
<h3>The service</h3>
<p>BuildWithBNZ provides three AI agents — Sara, Taylor and Emma — that work inside a construction project workspace. The agents prepare drafts, estimates, sub lists and reports. Anything that leaves your company is sent only after you review and approve it. The agents do not sign, award, pay or commit on your behalf.</p>
<h3>Engagement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every engagement starts with a Project Review about one real project. There is no charge for the review.</li>
<li>If we proceed, you receive a scope document stating what the crew will do, what it will not do, and one set price for that project, in writing, before work starts. Price moves only if scope moves, and only by written agreement.</li>
<li>After the first project the crew can stay on under a separate written arrangement for ongoing operations — hosting, monitoring, new projects and a weekly report. Its terms are set out in that document.</li>
<li>No prices are published on this website because every project is scoped individually.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your responsibilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>You are responsible for reviewing drafts, estimates and documents before they are sent, submitted or relied upon.</li>
<li>Estimates are prepared from the documents you provide. Where information is missing the estimate says UNKNOWN; it is not a bid, a quote or a guarantee of cost.</li>
<li>Taylor's design-assist work is not licensed design. Stamped drawings and engineering remain the responsibility of your architect or engineer of record.</li>
<li>Keep your workspace credentials secure. Each workspace belongs to one company and one or more scoped projects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Liability</h3>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, BNZ Builders Inc. is not liable for indirect or consequential loss arising from use of the service, and our total liability under an engagement is limited to the amount paid for that engagement.</p>
<h3>Contact</h3>
